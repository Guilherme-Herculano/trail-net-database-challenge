# DIO - .NET Track - Database
www.dio.me

## Project challenge
For this challenge, you will need to use your knowledge acquired in the database module of DIO's .NET track.

## Context
You are responsible for the database of a movie website, where data about movies and their actors is stored. You have therefore been asked to perform a query on the database in order to bring up some data for analysis.

## Proposal
You will need to perform 12 queries on the database, each returning a different type of information.
Your database is modeled as follows:

![Database diagram](Images/diagrama.png)

The tables are described as follows:

**Filmes**

Table responsible for storing movie information.

**Atores**

Table responsible for storing actor information.

**Generos**

Table responsible for storing movie genres.

**ElencoFilme**

Table responsible for representing a many-to-many relationship between films and actors, i.e. an actor can work in many films, and films
can have many actors.

**FilmesGenero**

Table responsible for representing a many-to-many relationship between films and genres, i.e. a film can have more than one genre, and a genre can be part of many films.

## Preparing the database
You must run the file **Script Filmes.sql** in your SQL Server database, in the Scripts folder of this repository ([or click here](Script%20Filmes.sql)). This script will create a database called **Films**, containing the tables and data you need to carry out this challenge.

## Objective
You will have to create several queries in order to return the following data. Below each request is the expected return. Your return should be the same as the image.

## 1 - Search for the name and year of the movie
